      <remarks>
            In fact, this string represents only a part of the command-line arguments. The seconds part comes from the related instance type definition.
            Thus, the commandLine member here respresents the dynamic part of the instance process's command-line while the instance type definition
            represents the static part of it.
            
            Pay an extra attention to the command line format because it use to be a source of tricky and difficult (time consuming) to find problems.
            Use spaces to distinguish individual arguments. If you want to pass several words (a text string containing spaces) as a single argument
            just enclose such character sequence in quotation marks.

             In your own implementation you can choose another destination for log messages.
             This example code shows how to send log messages to a file.

            This is one of the most important classes in uZone. It is the main class of the client side of the system.

      <remarks>
            This class allows the client to connect to a uZone Master server, list to existing nodes and instances,
            request to start a new Instance, register to various events and much more.
            <para />
            The first thing you have to do is to initialize it by calling the

            method.
            <para />
            Consequently you have to connect to a uZone Master server. That can be done by calling the
            <see cref="M:uZone.InstanceManager.Connect(System.String,System.Int32)" />
            method. Once you are successfully connected you can use all the remaining parts of the API. Conversely,
            if you are not connected, many methods will throw the

            That usualy happens when the application is not launched via uZone system but directly.
            
            The triggering of this event does mean that the instance application is not a part of the

            This is not an notification event but a signal. The application is responsible to terminate
